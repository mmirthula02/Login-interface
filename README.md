# Login-interface

This a mini project called as the login interface.
IDE used - NetBeans.

In this project I have designed a java form which accepts username and password to log into your favourite portal.
I have coded the project in such a way if the user enters the right user name and password it helps 
the former to enter the portal displaying the message "Login Successful"
